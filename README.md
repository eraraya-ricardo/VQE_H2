# VQE_H2
Exploring the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for estimating the ground state energy and wave function for H<sub>2</sub> molecule. As a comparison, numerical simulations with Full CI method (using PySCF package) were carried out. The motivation, theory, simmulation design, and results can be read on the [Review Paper.pdf]()
