# VQE_H2
Exploring the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for estimating the ground state energy and wave function for H<sub>2</sub> molecule. As a comparison, numerical simulations with Full CI method were carried out. This is a more in depth review of the [VQE demo by PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_vqe.html)
The motivation, theory, simmulation design, and results can be read on the [Review Paper.pdf](https://github.com/eraraya-ricardo/VQE_H2/blob/main/Paper%20Review.pdf).

The [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) package is used as the quantum programming framework. <br>
[PySCF](https://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/) is used for the Full CI simulations. <br>
The ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\LaTeX) (Overleaf) template, quantum-plots.ipynb and quantum-plots.mplstyle were provided by the [Quantum Journal](https://quantum-journal.org/) [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quantum-journal/quantum-journal).
